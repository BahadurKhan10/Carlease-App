# 🚗 MyNextCarLease (Flutter Mobile App)

A feature-rich car leasing mobile application built using **Flutter**, designed to connect car sellers and buyers with a modern, user-friendly interface. The app allows sellers to list vehicles while buyers can **filter and browse cars using 8–9 search criteria** such as price, model, mileage, transmission, fuel type, and more.

The mobile app includes:

- 🔍 Advanced search and filter system  
- 💬 **In-app chat** between buyers and sellers  
- 🖼️ **AI-based image detection** (only shows valid car images)  
- 📞 Integrated support contact and issue reporting  
- 👁️ Vehicle detail view tracking (who viewed which car)  
- 📱 Optimized UI/UX for Android & iOS devices  

The backend is powered by **Node.js**, while images are stored on **AWS S3** and deployed via **AWS EC2**. The mobile app is built separately from the web (Next.js + TypeScript).
